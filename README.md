# Debugger Duck!
## A virtual duck to listen to your problems while you code!

### How to setup

1. Clone this git repository
2. Point your shell to the directory of the repository
3. `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. `npm run start` to start it up
5. Point your browser the address that shows (usually something like `localhost:8080`)

### How to use

DebuggerDuck takes input from you in two ways. Either you can talk to it using your microphone or you can type to it like you would in a chat with somebody. 

Sorry - DebuggerDuck doesn't have a lot to say. But maybe that's a good thing. Just type your problems out and see where it takes you. Hopefully the duck helps you find your way.

### Other information

DebuggerDuck is built with the following:

- Modern Javascript (browser's that don't support Speech won't work with that feature)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Milligram](https://milligram.io/)

DebuggerDuck was built by [SomeShinyObject](https://someshinyobject.com) on a day he realized he needed a duck to talk to.
